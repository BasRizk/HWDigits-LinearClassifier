# HWDigits-LinearClassifier
Implementing a K-Linear-Discriminant Function (Classifying one-against-many) using different linear descriminator classification functions:

**Least Square Error** 

**Perceptron Based**

**Naive-Bayes Classifier**


This work was implemented as part of the coursework of "Machine Learning" graduate course, in the German University in Cairo.
